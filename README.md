[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

## Become a Sponsor to freeCodeCamp

In 2014, a teacher started an open source community called freeCodeCamp.org. This community has grown to include millions of developers from around the world. Together, we have built:

üíª A free 3,000-hour programming curriculum.

üèõÔ∏è Forums and chat rooms where you can get coding help and feedback on your projects.

üß™ 8,000+ coding tutorials.

üéí 1,000+ free YouTube courses on Computer Science, Data Science, and Machine Learning.

We are fully donor-supported. And we are extremely capital-efficient.

Last year our budget was only about $400,000. And yet we served more than 1 billion minutes of learning.

Each dollar you give to freeCodeCamp.org translates into 50 hours worth of learning for people around the world.
